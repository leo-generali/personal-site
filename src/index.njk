    <p>I'm currently working over at {% link "Hearst Autos", "https://www.hearstautos.com/" %} on the Car & Driver brand where I help connect automobile shoppers and vendors.</p>
    <p>Getting in touch with me is easy! You can find me on {% link "Twitter", "https://twitter.com/itsLeeOhGee" %}, {% link "LinkedIn", "https://www.linkedin.com/in/leogenerali/"%}, or {% link "Github", "https://github.com/leo-generali" %}. To say hello,
      you can reach my by email {% link "here", "mailto:me@leogenerali.com?Subject=Hello!" %}.</p>
    <p>If I'm not coding, I'm probably out running. I try and post all of my runs on Strava. If that sounds like your type of thing, you can check that out over {% link "here", "https://www.strava.com/athletes/11876587"%}.</p>
    <p> When I find myself with a spare minute or two I enjoy working on personal projects. I'll typically try to solve an issue I'm running into. I learn a thing or two in the process and maybe solve a problem for others too. Here are some of the cooler things I've made:</p>
