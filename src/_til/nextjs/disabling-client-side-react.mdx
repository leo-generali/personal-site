NextJS has a hidden feature that stops pages from hydrating with client-side React JavaScript code. This means it's possible to use NextJS and get all the benefits of JSX as a templating language without shipping unnecessary React code to your users.

This might not always be useful but there are times when it proves helpful. This blog is the perfect example use-case. It's not very interactive and doesn't need any JavaScript to function.

To disable client-side JavaScript [the following code](https://twitter.com/timneutkens/status/1316132404227178498?s=20) can be added to any component under your `/pages` directory:

```javascript
export const config = {
  unstable_runtimeJS: false
};
```

This will remove any JavaScript from the final build of that page. This will **not** remove client-side code from other pages, so interactivity can be decided on a per-page basis.

This blog makes heavy use of the above snippet. I want to keep it as lightweight as possible and avoid shipping JavaScript to the browser.
